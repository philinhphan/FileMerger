## üõ† Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run FileMerger on your local machine.

### üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.7 or higher**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pip**: Python package installer (comes with Python)
- **Git**: Version control system (optional, for cloning the repository)

### üì• Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/philinhphan/FileMerger.git
   ```

   Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/philinhphan/FileMerger) and extract it to your desired location.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd FileMerger
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

   Creating a virtual environment helps manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - **Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Note**: If `requirements.txt` is not present, you can install the necessary packages manually:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask werkzeug PyYAML
   ```

   Additionally, if you plan to handle Markdown conversions, install the `markdown` module:

   ```bash
   pip install markdown
   ```

### üèÉ Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask Server**

   Ensure you're in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated. Then, run:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   You should see output similar to:

   ```
   * Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
   * Environment: production
     WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
     Use a production WSGI server instead.
   * Debug mode: on
   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
   ```

2. **Access the Application**

   Open your web browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

## üõ† Troubleshooting

Encountering issues? Here are some common problems and their solutions:

1. **Unsupported File Type Error**

   - **Cause**: Attempting to upload a file with an unsupported extension.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that the file has one of the supported extensions listed above.

2. **File Too Large Error**

   - **Cause**: Uploading a file larger than 5MB.
   - **Solution**: Compress the file or choose a different file within the size limit.

3. **Server Not Running**

   - **Cause**: The Flask server isn't active.
   - **Solution**: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run `python app.py` to start the server.

4. **MIME Type Validation Error**

   - **Cause**: The server detects an invalid MIME type for the uploaded file.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that the file content matches its extension and is a valid text-based file.

5. **Unicode Decode Error**

   - **Cause**: The uploaded file contains characters that cannot be decoded as UTF-8.
   - **Solution**: Verify that the file is a valid text file encoded in UTF-8.

6. **Merged File Not Downloading**

   - **Cause**: An issue with the session or temporary file cleanup.
   - **Solution**: Restart the Flask server and try the merging process again. Ensure that no errors are present in the terminal.
